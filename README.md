# Hi there 👋, I'm Ameen

## About Me
I'm a passionate **Computer Science Engineering student** with a focus on **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**. I started my coding journey just 6 months ago and have been diving deep into various areas of development since then.

### What I Like About Coding:
- 💻 **Web Development**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript are my go-to tools for building intuitive and visually appealing websites.
- 🧠 **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**: I'm fascinated by how machines can learn and solve complex problems.
- 🎨 **Design**: Crafting clean, minimal, and professional layouts with a chill theme is something I enjoy.

I've quickly picked up **web development** skills, and my focus has been on creating clean and aesthetic UI designs. I'm also learning about data structures and algorithms to sharpen my problem-solving abilities.
